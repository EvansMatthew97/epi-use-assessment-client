Manual\nServer Repository\nDescription\nClient source for EPI-USE technical assessment project. The client-side code provides a user interface created in Angular which consumes the server API.\nUseful information regarding the use of endpoints can be found in the documentation link provided above.\nThis repository is configured to automatically deploy to Heroku, run unit tests and deploy documentation to Github pages.\n\nTechnology choices\nThis project is coded using Angular. Angular provides a modular MVC framework for cross-platform web development. It has a rich ecosystem (npm) and large community support. Being web-based, it can be deployed to the web as well as desktop (using Electron.js) and mobile (using Cordova). This makes future deployment simpler using a single code base.\nExpress.js is used to host the application on Heroku. Express is simple and fast to set up, but also reasonably secure with a large community backing it. Heroku is free and provides continuous deployment for this project.\nDevelopment\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nTests\nNote no tests have been implemented yet\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
